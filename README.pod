=head1 Group-Git

The C<group-git> tool allows you perform operations on many git
repositories at once. For example updating many repositores with the latest
upstream code:

 group-git pull

Would update all git repositories in the current directory.

Several C<git> comands have some extras such as C<status>
(L<Group::Git::Cmd::Status>) which adds the C<--quiet> parameter which
will suppress output for repositories with not changes.

There are also tool to help with various git repository servers such as

=over 4

=item *

Github

=item *

Bitbucket Server (nee Stash)

=item *

Gitosis

=head2 Repository Helpers

These helpers allow you to store your credentials in a C<group-git.yml>
configuration file and will find all repositories you have access to. If you
use the C<group-git pull> command it will automatically clone any repository
not currently downloaded for you.

=head2 Tagging repositories

You can also tag repositories to limit opperations to a subset of available
repositories. There are 3 ways to tag repositories:

=over 4

=item *

Add a tag file(s) to the root of the repository (eg C<.my-tag.tag>)

=item *

Use a tagger library, C<Group::Git> comes with two, remore and local which
determine if the repository has a remote or not.

=item *

The Bitbucket server helper will tag repositories with their project.
